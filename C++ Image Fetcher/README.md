I'm still working on this, it fetches a bit slow, but Ill try threading it later.

Look at the source.cpp for an example of how to fetch using the ReqPicture header file.

If you want to go even deeper then look at the FetchPicture() function inside ReqPicture.h

You can then slowly go deeper from there, by looking at the ReqPicture class functions which FetchPicture() calls.
